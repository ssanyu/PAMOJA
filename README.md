# PAMOJA
PAMOJA is a Java-based component framework providing support for grammar-aware engineering (GAE) in an integrated development environment (IDE). It provides a collection of components that deal with transformation of language terms from a concrete textual form to abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and the converse transformation from abstract to concrete. PAMOJA offers easier incorporation of GAE tasks, such as scanning, parsing, tree building, and formatting, in general IDEs (like NetBeans and Eclipse) so that they can be used in the construction of all kinds of software applications â€“ other than compilers- that do some language processing as a necessary but subordinate task. The main development styles supported by PAMOJA are drag-and-drop and wizards commonly found in modern IDEs.
